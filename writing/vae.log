I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
or \cr or \span just now. If something like a right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Missing \cr inserted.
<inserted text>
                \cr
l.35 \frac
          {f(s, t)}{f_S(s)}, 	&\text{if $f_S(s)>0$,}\\
I'm guessing that you meant to end an alignment here.

! Misplaced \cr.
<inserted text> \cr

l.35 \frac
          {f(s, t)}{f_S(s)}, 	&\text{if $f_S(s)>0$,}\\
(That makes 100 errors; please try again.)
